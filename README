Summary
This logical knowledge base maintains a set of logical statements and will evaluate user queries
based on the contents of it's knowledge base. The knowledge base supports propositional and first
order logic. The user can 'tell' the knowledge base to store new information, and ask it to
evaluate new or known queries.

Variables known to the knowledge base are assumed to be true. For example, suppose the knowledge
base is only aware of the boolean values A and B. Then if we ask the knowledge base is evaluate A
or B, it will return True. If we ask the knowledge to evaluate some unknown value C, the evaluation
will return False.

The ultimate goal of this project is to be used in a planning AI agent.


TODO:
- Nested quantifiers

- KnowledgeBase entails should not only evaluate the query but also make logical jumps
- KnowledgeBase tests

- Write interpreter
